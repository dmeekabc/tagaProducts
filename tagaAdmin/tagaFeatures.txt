TAGA Features:
=============================

  Deployment:
  -----------
  1. Auto Self Replication
  2. Auto Key Generation and Distribution

  Run-time:
  -----------
  1. Auto Configuration of Interface Names (via targetList)
  2. Auto Configuration of Host Names (via targetList)
  3. Auto Network Node Time Synchronization Verification
  4. Auto Distribution of (updates to) Configuration
  5. Auto File Collection and Process Cleanup
  6. Auto Generation of Analytical Artifacts
  7. Auto resource utilization monitor and display
  8. Distributed Processing provides for robust data generation and collection
  9. Policy-Based Management (e.g. Log Mgt and Network Overhead Control) (Note1)
  10. New: Auto Fault Detection and Recovery (Condition-based Automatic Node and Network-wide Reboots) 
         - this allows for *unmanned* and *24x7* testing 
  11. New: (proprietary) TAGA Convergence utility
         - this simplifies determination of network stability, usability and test scenario repeatability
  12. New: Completely distributed and synchronized traffic generation initiation
  13. New: Six levels of run-time output - user specified

  Extendability:
  -----------
  1. Start of Test (Traffic), Middle of Test (Traffic), and End of Run Test (Traffic) Test Shells Provided
  2. TAGA Provided Samples include Pub/Sub implementation and File Input/output in Python and C languages 

  Scalability:
  -----------
  1. TAGA Display scales automatically based on node count and duration 
  2. TAGA 'Run and Mon' Utility scales automatically based on target list update 
  3. TAGA Utility scales well by limiting configuration changes to two primary configuration 
     files (config, targetList.sh) and a few key params (timer delays, traffic rates/counts, etc)
  4. Round-robin and staggered starts help avoid traffic overload during large network tests

  Ease of Use:
  -----------
  1. Basic Network Health Check at a single commmand (run or mon)
  2. Tailorability of Displays
  3. Standardized INFO, WARN, and ALARM tags simplify filtering (Note1)
  4. "Go Remote" "Probe" "Prep" "TimeTimer" and other time saving utilities
  5. Human Readable and Tailorable Timestamps
  6. Multiple Interfaces per Host supported (Note1)

  Recent Additions:
  -----------
  1. ta - trace alias utility
  2. rebootAll alias enhancement 

  Other:
  -----------
  1. IBOA Auto Alias Utility is bundled with the TAGA Framework Release
      - enables fast and automatic creation of individual and group (team) specialized aliases
          - smart aliases increase workflow and productivity by reducing keystrokes and input errors
          - smart aliases allow for more work at the end of the day and reduce cycle times 
      - enables fast filter creation for enhanced data analysis
      - fosters teamwork, collaboration, and communication
  2. Sample Filters and other extensions available upon request to info@iboa.us

=============================
TAGA System Requirements:
=============================

1. Linux-like operating environment
2. Bash or equivalent shell (for full capabilities)
3. libssh (ssh)
4. libpcap (tcpdump)
5. mgen, iperf, or similar traffic generation engines

---------
NOTES:
---------
Note1: Initial/Partial Support Only
